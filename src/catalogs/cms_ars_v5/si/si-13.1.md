# si-13.1 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Transferring Component Responsibilities

## Control Statement

Take system components out of service by transferring component responsibilities to substitute components no later than {{ insert: param, si-13.1_prm_1 }} of mean time to failure.

## Control guidance

Transferring primary system component responsibilities to other substitute components prior to primary component failure is important to reduce the risk of degraded or debilitated mission or business operations. Making such transfers based on a percentage of mean time to failure allows organizations to be proactive based on their risk tolerance. However, premature replacement of system components can result in increased cost of system operations.
