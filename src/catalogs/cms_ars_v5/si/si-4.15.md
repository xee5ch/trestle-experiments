# si-4.15 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Wireless to Wireline Communications

## Control Statement

Employ an intrusion detection system to monitor wireless communications traffic as the traffic passes from wireless to wireline networks.

## Control guidance

Wireless networks are inherently less secure than wired networks. For example, wireless networks are more susceptible to eavesdroppers or traffic analysis than wireline networks. Employing intrusion detection systems to monitor wireless communications traffic helps to ensure that the traffic does not contain malicious code prior to transitioning to the wireline network.
