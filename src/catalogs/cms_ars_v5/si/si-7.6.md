# si-7.6 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Cryptographic Protection

## Control Statement

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to detect unauthorized changes to software, firmware, and information.

## Control guidance

Cryptographic mechanisms used to protect integrity include digital signatures and the computation and application of signed hashes using asymmetric cryptography; protecting the confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash; and using the public key to verify the hash information. Organizations employing cryptographic mechanisms also consider cryptographic key management solutions (see SC-12 and SC-13).
