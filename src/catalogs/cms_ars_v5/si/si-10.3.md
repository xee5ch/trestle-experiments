# si-10.3 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Predictable Behavior

## Control Statement

Verify that the system behaves in a predictable and documented manner when invalid inputs are received.

## Control guidance

A common vulnerability in organizational systems is unpredictable behavior when invalid inputs are received. This control enhancement ensures that there is predictable behavior when the system receives invalid inputs by specifying system responses that allow the system to transition to known states without adverse, unintended side effects. The invalid inputs are those inputs related to the information inputs defined by the organization in the base control.
