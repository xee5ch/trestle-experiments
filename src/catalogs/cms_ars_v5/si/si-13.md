# si-13 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Predictable Failure Prevention

## Control Statement

- \[a\] Determine mean time to failure (MTTF) for the following system components in specific environments of operation: {{ insert: param, si-13_prm_1 }}; and

- \[b\] Provide substitute system components and a means to exchange active and standby components in accordance with the following criteria: {{ insert: param, si-13_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

While MTTF is primarily a reliability issue, this control addresses potential failures of system components that provide security capability. Failure rates reflect installation-specific consideration, not industry-average. Organizations define the criteria for substitution of system components based on the MTTF value with consideration for resulting potential harm from component failures. Transfer of responsibilities between active and standby components does not compromise safety, operational readiness, or security capability. This includes preservation of system state variables. Standby components remain available at all times except for maintenance issues or recovery failures in progress.
