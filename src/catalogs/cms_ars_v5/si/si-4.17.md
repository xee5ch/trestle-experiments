# si-4.17 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Integrated Situational Awareness

## Control Statement

Correlate information from monitoring physical, cyber, and supply chain activities to achieve integrated, organization-wide situational awareness.

## Control guidance

Correlating monitoring information from a more diverse set of information sources helps to achieve integrated situational awareness. Integrated situational awareness from a combination of physical, cyber, and supply chain monitoring activities enhances the capability of organizations to more quickly detect sophisticated attacks and investigate the methods and techniques employed to carry out such attacks. In contrast to SI-4(16) that correlates the various cyber monitoring information, this control enhancement correlates monitoring beyond the cyber domain. Such monitoring may help reveal attacks on organizations that are operating across multiple attack vectors.
