# si-3.9 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Authenticate Remote Commands

## Control Statement

Implement {{ insert: param, si-3.9_prm_1 }} to authenticate {{ insert: param, si-3.9_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement protects against unauthorized remote commands and the replay of authorized commands. This capability is important for those remote systems whose loss, malfunction, misdirection, or exploitation would have immediate and/or serious consequences, including, for example, injury or death, property damage, loss of high-value assets, compromise of classified or controlled unclassified information, or failure of missions or business functions. Authentication safeguards for remote commands ensure that systems accept and execute commands in the order intended, execute only authorized commands, and reject unauthorized commands. Cryptographic mechanisms can be employed, for example, to authenticate remote commands.
