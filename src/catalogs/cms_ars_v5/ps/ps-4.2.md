## Control Statement

Notify {{ insert: param, ps-4.2_prm_1 }} of individual termination actions using {{ insert: param, ps-4.2_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

In organizations with many employees, not all personnel who need to know about termination actions receive the appropriate notificationsâ€”or, if such notifications are received, they may not occur in a timely manner. Automated mechanisms can be used to send automatic alerts or notifications to organizational personnel or roles when individuals are terminated. Such automatic alerts or notifications can be conveyed in a variety of ways, including telephonically, via electronic mail, via text message, or via websites.
