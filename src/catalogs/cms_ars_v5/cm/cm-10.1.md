## Control guidance

Open source software refers to software that is available in source code form. Certain software rights normally reserved for copyright holders are routinely provided under software license agreements that permit individuals to study, change, and improve the software. From a security perspective, the major advantage of open source software is that it provides organizations with the ability to examine the source code. However, remediating vulnerabilities in open source software may be problematic. There may also be licensing issues associated with open source software, including the constraints on derivative use of such software. Open source software that is available only in binary form may increase the level of risk in using such software.
