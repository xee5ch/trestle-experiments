# cm-8 - \[Configuration Management\] System Component Inventory

## Control Statement

- \[a\] Develop and document an inventory of system components that:

  - \[1\] Accurately reflects the system;
  - \[2\] Includes all components within the system;
  - \[3\] Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting; and
  - \[4\] Includes the following information to achieve system component accountability: {{ insert: param, cm-8_prm_1 }}; and

- \[b\] Review and update the system component inventory {{ insert: param, cm-8_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

System components are discrete, identifiable information technology assets that include hardware, software, and firmware. Organizations may choose to implement centralized system component inventories that include components from all organizational systems. In such situations, organizations ensure that the inventories include system-specific information required for component accountability. The information necessary for effective accountability of system components includes system name, software owners, software version numbers, hardware inventory specifications, software license information, and for networked components, the machine names and network addresses across all implemented protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). Inventory specifications include date of receipt, cost, model, serial number, manufacturer, supplier information, component type, and physical location.
