# cm-4 - \[Configuration Management\] Impact Analyses

## Control Statement

Analyze changes to the system to determine potential security and privacy impacts prior to change implementation.

## Control guidance

Organizational personnel with security or privacy responsibilities conduct impact analyses. Individuals conducting impact analyses possess the necessary skills and technical expertise to analyze the changes to systems and the security or privacy ramifications. Impact analyses include reviewing security and privacy plans, policies, and procedures to understand control requirements; reviewing system design documentation and operational procedures to understand control implementation and how specific system changes might affect the controls; reviewing with stakeholders the impact of changes on organizational supply chain partners; and determining how potential changes to a system create new risks to the privacy of individuals and the ability of implemented controls to mitigate those risks. Impact analyses also include risk assessments to understand the impact of the changes and to determine if additional controls are required.
