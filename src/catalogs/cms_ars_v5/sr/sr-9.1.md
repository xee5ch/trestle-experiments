# sr-9.1 - \[Supply Chain Risk Management\] Multiple Stages of System Development Life Cycle

## Control Statement

Employ anti-tamper technologies, tools, and techniques during multiple stages in the system development life cycle, including design, development, integration, operations, and maintenance.

## Control guidance

Organizations use a combination of hardware and software techniques for tamper resistance and detection. Organizations employ obfuscation and self-checking, for example, to make reverse engineering and modifications more difficult, time-consuming, and expensive for adversaries. The customization of systems and system components can make substitutions easier to detect and therefore limit damage.
