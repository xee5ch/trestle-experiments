# ra-5.3 - \[Risk Assessment\] Breadth and Depth of Coverage

## Control Statement

Define the breadth and depth of vulnerability scanning coverage.

## Control guidance

The breadth of vulnerability scanning coverage can be expressed, for example, as a percentage of components within the system, by the particular types of systems, by the criticality of systems, or by the number of vulnerabilities to be checked. Conversely, the depth of vulnerability scanning coverage can be expressed as the level of the system design the organization intends to monitor (e.g., component, module, subsystem). Organizations can determine the sufficiency of vulnerability scanning coverage with regard to its risk tolerance and other factors. [SP 800-53A] provides additional information on the breadth and depth of coverage.
