## Control Statement

- \[a\] Conduct a risk assessment, including:

  - \[1\] The likelihood and magnitude of harm from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of the system, the information it processes, stores, or transmits, and any related information; and
  - \[2\] The likelihood and impact of adverse effects on individuals arising from the processing of personally identifiable information;

- \[b\] Integrate risk assessment results and risk management decisions from the organization and mission or business process perspectives with system-level risk assessments;

- \[c\] Document risk assessment results in {{ insert: param, ra-3_prm_1 }};

- \[d\] Review risk assessment results {{ insert: param, ra-3_prm_3 }};

- \[e\] Disseminate risk assessment results to {{ insert: param, ra-3_prm_4 }}; and

- \[f\] Update the risk assessment {{ insert: param, ra-3_prm_5 }} or when there are significant changes to the system, its environment of operation, or other conditions that may impact the security or privacy state of the system.

## Control guidance

Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective risk assessments. Risk assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the operation and use of systems. Risk assessments also consider risk from external parties, including individuals accessing organizational systems; contractors operating systems on behalf of the organization; service providers; and outsourcing entities. Organizations can conduct risk assessments at all three levels in the risk management hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information system level) and at any stage in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted at various steps in the Risk Management Framework, including categorization, control selection, control implementation, control assessment, system authorization, and control monitoring. Risk assessment is an ongoing activity carried out throughout the system development life cycle. In addition to the information processed, stored, and transmitted by the system, risk assessments can also address any information related to the system, including system design, the intended use of the system, testing results, and other supply chain-related information or artifacts. Assessments of risk can play an important role in control selection processes, particularly during the application of tailoring guidance and in the earliest phases of capability determination.
