# at-2.6 - \[Awareness and Training\] Advanced Persistent Threat

## Control Statement

Provide awareness training on the advanced persistent threat.

## Control guidance

An effective way to detect advanced persistent threats (APT) and to preclude success attacks is to provide specific awareness training for individuals. Threat awareness training includes educating individuals on the various ways APTs can infiltrate into the organization (e.g., through websites, emails, advertisement pop-ups, articles, and social engineering). Effective training includes techniques for recognizing suspicious emails, use of removable systems in non-secure settings, and the potential targeting of individuals at home.
