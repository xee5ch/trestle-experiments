# at-2.2 - \[Awareness and Training\] Insider Threat

## Control Statement

Provide awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider threat.

## Control guidance

Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threat can include behaviors such as inordinate, long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts to gain access to information not required for job performance; unexplained access to financial resources; bullying or sexual harassment of fellow employees; workplace violence; and other serious violations of policies, procedures, directives, regulations, rules, or practices. Awareness training includes how to communicate concerns of employees and management regarding potential indicators of insider threat through channels established by the organization and in accordance with established policies and procedures. Organizations may consider tailoring insider threat awareness topics to the role. For example, training for managers may be focused on changes in behavior of team members, while training for employees may be focused on more general observations.
