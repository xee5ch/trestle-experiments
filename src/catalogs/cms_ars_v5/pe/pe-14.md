# pe-14 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Environmental Controls

## Control Statement

- \[a\] Maintain {{ insert: param, pe-14_prm_1 }} levels within the facility where the system resides at {{ insert: param, pe-14_prm_3 }}; and

- \[b\] Monitor environmental control levels {{ insert: param, pe-14_prm_4 }}.

## Control guidance

The provision of environmental controls applies primarily to organizational facilities containing concentrations of system resources, for example, data centers, server rooms, and mainframe computer rooms. Insufficient controls, especially in harsh environments, can have a significant adverse impact on the systems and system components that are needed to support organizational missions and business functions. Environmental controls, such as electromagnetic pulse (EMP) protection described in PE-21, are especially significant for systems and applications that are part of the U.S. critical infrastructure.
