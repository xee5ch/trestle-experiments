Hardware components that require marking include input devices marked to indicate the classification of the network to which the devices are connected or a multifunction printer or copier residing in a classified area. Security marking refers to the use of human-readable security attributes. Security labeling refers to the use of security attributes for internal data structures within systems. Security marking is generally not required for hardware components processing, storing, or transmitting information determined by organizations to be in the public domain or to be publicly releasable. However, organizations may require markings for hardware components processing, storing, or transmitting public information indicating that such information is publicly releasable. Marking of system hardware components reflects applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards.
