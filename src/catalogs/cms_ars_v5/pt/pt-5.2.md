# pt-5.2 - \[Personally Identifiable Information Processing and Transparency\] Just-in-time Consent

## Control Statement

Present {{ insert: param, pt-5.2_prm_1 }} to individuals at a time and location where the individual provides personally identifiable information or in conjunction with a data action.

## Control guidance

Just-in-time consent enables individuals to participate in how their personally identifiable information is being processed at the time when such participation may be most useful to the individual. Individual assumptions about how personally identifiable information will be processed might not be accurate or reliable if time has passed since the individual last gave consent or the particular circumstances under which consent was given have changed. Organizations use discretion to determine when to use just-in-time consent and may use supporting information on demographics, focus groups, or surveys to learn more about individualsâ€™ privacy interests and concerns.
