# ac-3.7 - \[Access Control\] Role-based Access Control

## Control Statement

Enforce a role-based access control policy over defined subjects and objects and control access based upon {{ insert: param, ac-3.7_prm_1 }}.

## Control guidance

Role-based access control (RBAC) is an access control policy that enforces access to objects and system functions based on the defined role (i.e., job function) of the subject. Organizations can create specific roles based on job functions and the authorizations (i.e., privileges) to perform needed operations on the systems associated with the organization-defined roles. When users are assigned to the specific roles, they inherit the authorizations or privileges defined for those roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration for because privileges are not assigned directly to every user (which can potentially be a large number of individuals) but are instead acquired through role assignments. RBAC can be implemented as a mandatory or discretionary form of access control. For those organizations implementing RBAC with mandatory access controls, the requirements in AC-3(3) define the scope of the subjects and objects covered by the policy.
