# ac-24 - \[Access Control\] Access Control Decisions

## Control Statement

 {{ insert: param, ac-24_prm_1 }} to ensure {{ insert: param, ac-24_prm_2 }} are applied to each access request prior to access enforcement.

## Control guidance

Access control decisions (also known as authorization decisions) occur when authorization information is applied to specific accesses. In contrast, access enforcement occurs when systems enforce access control decisions. While it is very common to have access control decisions and access enforcement implemented by the same entity, it is not required, and it is not always an optimal implementation choice. For some architectures and distributed systems, different entities may perform access control decisions and access enforcement.
