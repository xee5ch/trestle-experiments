# ac-3.15 - \[Access Control\] Discretionary and Mandatory Access Control

## Control Statement

- \[a\] Enforce {{ insert: param, ac-3.15_prm_1 }} over the set of covered subjects and objects specified in the policy; and

- \[b\] Enforce {{ insert: param, ac-3.15_prm_2 }} over the set of covered subjects and objects specified in the policy.

## Control guidance

Implementing a mandatory access control policy and a discretionary access control policy simultaneously can provide additional protection against the unauthorized execution of code by users or processes acting on behalf of users. This helps prevent a single compromised user or process from compromising the entire system.
