# ac-10 - \[Access Control\] Concurrent Session Control

## Control Statement

Limit the number of concurrent sessions for each {{ insert: param, ac-10_prm_1 }} to {{ insert: param, ac-10_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

Organizations may define the maximum number of concurrent sessions for system accounts globally, by account type, by account, or any combination thereof. For example, organizations may limit the number of concurrent sessions for system administrators or other individuals working in particularly sensitive domains or mission-critical applications. This control addresses concurrent sessions for system accounts and does not address concurrent sessions by single users via multiple system accounts.
