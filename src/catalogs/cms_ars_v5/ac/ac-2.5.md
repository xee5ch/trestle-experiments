# ac-2.5 - \[Access Control\] Inactivity Logout

## Control Statement

Require that users log out when {{ insert: param, ac-2.5_prm_1 }}.

## Control guidance

Inactivity logout is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to log out when they are expecting inactivity longer than the defined period. Automatic enforcement of this control enhancement is addressed by AC-11.
