## Control Statement

 {{ insert: param, sc-41_prm_1 }} disable or remove {{ insert: param, sc-41_prm_2 }} on the following systems or system components: {{ insert: param, sc-41_prm_3 }}.

## Control guidance

Connection ports include Universal Serial Bus (USB), Thunderbolt, Firewire (IEEE 1394). Input/output (I/O) devices include Compact Disk (CD) and Digital Versatile Disk (DVD) drives. Disabling or removing such connection ports and I/O devices helps prevent exfiltration of information from systems and the introduction of malicious code into systems from those ports or devices. Physically disabling or removing ports and/or devices is the stronger action.
