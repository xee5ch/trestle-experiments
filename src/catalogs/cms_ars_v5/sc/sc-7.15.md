# sc-7.15 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Networked Privileged Accesses

## Control Statement

Route networked, privileged accesses through a dedicated, managed interface for purposes of access control and auditing.

## Control guidance

Privileged access provides greater accessibility to system functions, including security functions. Adversaries typically attempt to gain privileged access to systems through remote access to cause adverse mission or business impact, for example, by exfiltrating sensitive information or bringing down a critical system capability. Routing networked, privileged access requests through a dedicated, managed interface can facilitate strong access controls (including strong authentication) and a comprehensive auditing capability.
