# sc-8.4 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Conceal or Randomize Communications

## Control Statement

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to conceal or randomize communication patterns unless otherwise protected by {{ insert: param, sc-8.4_prm_1 }}.

## Control guidance

Concealing or randomizing communication patterns addresses protection from unauthorized disclosure of information. Communication patterns include frequency, periods, predictability, and amount. Changes to communications patterns can reveal information having intelligence value especially when combined with other available information related to the missions and business functions of the organization. This control enhancement prevents the derivation of intelligence based on communications patterns and applies to both internal and external networks or links that may be visible to individuals who are not authorized users. Encrypting the links and transmitting in continuous, fixed or random patterns prevents the derivation of intelligence from the system communications patterns. Alternative physical controls include protected distribution systems.
