# sc-26 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Decoys

## Control Statement

Include components within organizational systems specifically designed to be the target of malicious attacks for detecting, deflecting, and analyzing such attacks.

## Control guidance

Decoys (i.e., honeypots, honeynets, or deception nets) are established to attract adversaries and to deflect attacks away from the operational systems supporting organizational missions and business functions. Depending upon the specific usage of the decoy, consultation with the Office of the General Counsel before deployment may be needed.
