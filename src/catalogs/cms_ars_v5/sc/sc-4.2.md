# sc-4.2 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Multilevel or Periods Processing

## Control Statement

Prevent unauthorized information transfer via shared resources in accordance with {{ insert: param, sc-4.2_prm_1 }} when system processing explicitly switches between different information classification levels or security categories.

## Control guidance

Changes in processing levels during system operations can occur, for example, during multilevel or periods processing with information at different classification levels or security categories. It can also occur during serial reuse of hardware components at different classification levels. Organization-defined procedures can include the approved sanitization processes for electronically stored information.
