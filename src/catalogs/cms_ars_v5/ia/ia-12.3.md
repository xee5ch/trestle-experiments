# ia-12.3 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Identity Evidence Validation and Verification

## Control Statement

Require that the presented identity evidence be validated and verified through {{ insert: param, ia-12.3_prm_1 }}.

## Control guidance

Validating and verifying identity evidence increases the assurance that accounts, identifiers, and authenticators are being issued to the correct user. Validation refers to the process of confirming that the evidence is genuine and authentic, and the data contained in the evidence is correct, current, and related to an actual person or individual. Verification confirms and establishes a linkage between the claimed identity and the actual existence of the user presenting the evidence. Acceptable methods for validating and verifying identity evidence are consistent with the risk to the systems, roles, and privileges associated with the users account
