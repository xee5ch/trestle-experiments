# ia-5.8 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Multiple System Accounts

## Control Statement

Implement {{ insert: param, ia-5.8_prm_1 }} to manage the risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple systems.

## Control guidance

When individuals have accounts on multiple systems, there is the risk that a compromise of one account may lead to the compromise of other accounts if individuals use the same authenticators. Alternatives include having different authenticators on all systems; employing a single sign-on mechanism; or using some form of one-time passwords on all systems. Organizations can also use rules of behavior (see PL-4) and access agreements (see PS-6) to mitigate the risk of multiple system accounts.
