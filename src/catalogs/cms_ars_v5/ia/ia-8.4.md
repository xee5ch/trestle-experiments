# ia-8.4 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Use of Nist-issued Profiles

## Control Statement

Conform to NIST-issued profiles for identity management.

## Control guidance

Conformance with NIST-issued profiles for identity management addresses open identity management standards. To ensure that open identity management standards are viable, robust, reliable, sustainable, and interoperable as documented, the United States Government assesses and scopes the standards and technology implementations against applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. The result is NIST-issued implementation profiles of approved protocols.
