## Control guidance

It is important for an organization to have a strategy in place for addressing incidents that have been brought to the attention of the general public and that have cast the organization in a negative light or affected the organization’s constituents (e.g., partners, customers). Such publicity can be extremely harmful to the organization and effect its ability to effectively carry out its missions and business functions. Taking proactive steps to repair the organization’s reputation is an essential aspect of reestablishing trust and confidence of its constituents.
