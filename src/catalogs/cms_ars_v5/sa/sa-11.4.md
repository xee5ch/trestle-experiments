# sa-11.4 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Manual Code Reviews

## Control Statement

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform a manual code review of {{ insert: param, sa-11.4_prm_1 }} using the following processes, procedures, and/or techniques: {{ insert: param, sa-11.4_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

Manual code reviews are usually reserved for the critical software and firmware components of systems. Manual code reviews are effective in identifying weaknesses that require knowledge of the applicationâ€™s requirements or context which in most cases, are unavailable to automated analytic tools and techniques, for example, static and dynamic analysis. The benefits of manual code review include the ability to verify access control matrices against application controls and review detailed aspects of cryptographic implementations and controls.
