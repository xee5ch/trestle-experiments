# sa-8.27 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Human Factored Security

## Control Statement

Implement the security design principle of human factored security in {{ insert: param, sa-8.27_prm_1 }}.

## Control guidance

The principle of human factored security states that the user interface for security functions and supporting services is intuitive, user friendly, and provides feedback for user actions that affect such policy and its enforcement. The mechanisms that enforce security policy are not intrusive to the user and are designed not to degrade user efficiency. Security policy enforcement mechanisms also provide the user with meaningful, clear, and relevant feedback and warnings when insecure choices are being made. Particular attention is given to interfaces through which personnel responsible for system administration and operation configure and set up the security policies. Ideally, these personnel are able to understand the impact of their choices. The personnel with system administrative and operation responsibility are able to configure systems before start-up and administer them during runtime, in both cases with confidence that their intent is correctly mapped to the systemâ€™s mechanisms. Security services, functions, and mechanisms do not impede or unnecessarily complicate the intended use of the system. There is a trade-off between system usability and the strictness necessitated for security policy enforcement. If security mechanisms are frustrating or difficult to use, then users may disable or avoid them, or use the mechanisms in ways inconsistent with the security requirements and protection needs the mechanisms were designed to satisfy.
