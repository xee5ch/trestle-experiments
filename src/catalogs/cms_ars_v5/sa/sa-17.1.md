# sa-17.1 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Formal Policy Model

## Control Statement

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to:

- \[a\] Produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal policy model describing the {{ insert: param, sa-17.1_prm_1 }} to be enforced; and

- \[b\] Prove that the formal policy model is internally consistent and sufficient to enforce the defined elements of the organizational security policy when implemented.

## Control guidance

Formal models describe specific behaviors or security policies using formal languages, thus enabling the correctness of those behaviors and policies to be formally proven. Not all components of systems can be modeled. Generally, formal specifications are scoped to the specific behaviors or policies of interest, for example, nondiscretionary access control policies. Organizations choose the formal modeling language and approach based on the nature of the behaviors and policies to be described and the available tools. Formal modeling tools include Gypsy and Zed.
