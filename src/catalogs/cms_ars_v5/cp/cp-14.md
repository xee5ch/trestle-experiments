# cp-14 - \[Contingency Planning\] Self-challenge

## Control Statement

Employ {{ insert: param, cp-14_prm_1 }} to {{ insert: param, cp-14_prm_2 }} to affect the system or system components in an adverse manner.

## Control guidance

Often the best means of assessing the effectiveness of the controls implemented within a system and the system resilience is to disrupt it in some manner. The autonomous service selected and implemented by the organization could disrupt system services in many ways, including terminating or disabling key system components, changing the configuration of system elements, altering privileges, or degrading critical functionality (e.g., restricting network bandwidth). Such automated, on-going, simulated cyber-attacks and service disruptions can reveal unexpected functional dependencies and help the organization determine its ability to ensure resilience in the face of an actual cyber-attack.
