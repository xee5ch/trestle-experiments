# cp-7.6 - \[Contingency Planning\] Inability to Return to Primary Site

## Control Statement

Plan and prepare for circumstances that preclude returning to the primary processing site.

## Control guidance

There may be situations that preclude an organization from returning to the primary processing site. This can occur, for example, if a natural disaster such as a flood or a hurricane damaged or destroyed a facility and it was determined that rebuilding in the same location was not prudent.
