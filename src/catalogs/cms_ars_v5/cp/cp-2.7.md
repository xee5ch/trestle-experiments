# cp-2.7 - \[Contingency Planning\] Coordinate with External Service Providers

## Control Statement

Coordinate the contingency plan with the contingency plans of external service providers to ensure that contingency requirements can be satisfied.

## Control guidance

When the capability of an organization to carry out its missions and business functions is dependent on external service providers, developing a comprehensive and timely contingency plan may become more challenging. When missions and business functions are dependent on external service providers, organizations coordinate contingency planning activities with the external entities to ensure that the individual plans reflect the overall contingency needs of the organization.
