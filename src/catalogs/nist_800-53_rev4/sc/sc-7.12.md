# sc-7.12 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Host-based Protection

## Control Statement

The organization implements {{ insert: param, sc-7.12_prm_1 }} at {{ insert: param, sc-7.12_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[1\] defines host-based boundary protection mechanisms;

- \[2\] defines information system components where organization-defined host-based boundary protection mechanisms are to be implemented; and

- \[3\] implements organization-defined host-based boundary protection mechanisms at organization-defined information system components.

## Control guidance

Host-based boundary protection mechanisms include, for example, host-based firewalls. Information system components employing host-based boundary protection mechanisms include, for example, servers, workstations, and mobile devices.
