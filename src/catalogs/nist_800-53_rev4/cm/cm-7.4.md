# cm-7.4 - \[Configuration Management\] Unauthorized Software / Blacklisting

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a\] Identifies {{ insert: param, cm-7.4_prm_1 }};

- \[b\] Employs an allow-all, deny-by-exception policy to prohibit the execution of unauthorized software programs on the information system; and

- \[c\] Reviews and updates the list of unauthorized software programs {{ insert: param, cm-7.4_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[a_obj\] Identifies/defines software programs not authorized to execute on the information system;

- \[b_obj\] employs an allow-all, deny-by-exception policy to prohibit the execution of unauthorized software programs on the information system;

- \[c_obj\]

  - \[1\] defines the frequency to review and update the list of unauthorized software programs on the information system; and
  - \[2\] reviews and updates the list of unauthorized software programs with the organization-defined frequency.

## Control guidance

The process used to identify software programs that are not authorized to execute on organizational information systems is commonly referred to as blacklisting. Organizations can implement CM-7 (5) instead of this control enhancement if whitelisting (the stronger of the two policies) is the preferred approach for restricting software program execution.
