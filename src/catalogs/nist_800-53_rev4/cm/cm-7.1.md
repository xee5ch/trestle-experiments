# cm-7.1 - \[Configuration Management\] Periodic Review

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a\] Reviews the information system {{ insert: param, cm-7.1_prm_1 }} to identify unnecessary and/or nonsecure functions, ports, protocols, and services; and

- \[b\] Disables {{ insert: param, cm-7.1_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[a_obj\]

  - \[1\] defines the frequency to review the information system to identify unnecessary and/or nonsecure:

    - \[a\] functions;
    - \[b\] ports;
    - \[c\] protocols; and/or
    - \[d\] services;

  - \[2\] reviews the information system with the organization-defined frequency to identify unnecessary and/or nonsecure:

    - \[a\] functions;
    - \[b\] ports;
    - \[c\] protocols; and/or
    - \[d\] services;

- \[b_obj\]

  - \[1\] defines, within the information system, unnecessary and/or nonsecure:

    - \[a\] functions;
    - \[b\] ports;
    - \[c\] protocols; and/or
    - \[d\] services;

  - \[2\] disables organization-defined unnecessary and/or nonsecure:

    - \[a\] functions;
    - \[b\] ports;
    - \[c\] protocols; and/or
    - \[d\] services.

## Control guidance

The organization can either make a determination of the relative security of the function, port, protocol, and/or service or base the security decision on the assessment of other entities. Bluetooth, FTP, and peer-to-peer networking are examples of less than secure protocols.
