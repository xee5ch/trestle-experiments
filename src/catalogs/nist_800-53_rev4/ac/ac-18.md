# ac-18 - \[Access Control\] Wireless Access

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a\] Establishes usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for wireless access; and

- \[b\] Authorizes wireless access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[a_obj\] establishes for wireless access:

  - \[1\] usage restrictions;
  - \[2\] configuration/connection requirement;
  - \[3\] implementation guidance; and

- \[b_obj\] authorizes wireless access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.

## Control guidance

Wireless technologies include, for example, microwave, packet radio (UHF/VHF), 802.11x, and Bluetooth. Wireless networks use authentication protocols (e.g., EAP/TLS, PEAP), which provide credential protection and mutual authentication.
