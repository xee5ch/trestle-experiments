# pe-5.2 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Access to Output by Individual Identity

## Control Statement

The information system:

- \[a\] Controls physical access to output from {{ insert: param, pe-5.2_prm_1 }}; and

- \[b\] Links individual identity to receipt of the output from the device.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[a_obj\]

  - \[1\] the organization defines output devices whose output requires physical access controls;
  - \[2\] the information system controls physical access to output from organization-defined output devices; and

- \[b_obj\] the information system links individual identity to receipt of the output from the device.

## Control guidance

Controlling physical access to selected output devices includes, for example, installing security functionality on printers, copiers, and facsimile machines that allows organizations to implement authentication (e.g., using a PIN or hardware token) on output devices prior to the release of output to individuals.
