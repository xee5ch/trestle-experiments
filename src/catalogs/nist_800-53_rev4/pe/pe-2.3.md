- \[2\] restricts unescorted access to the facility where the information system resides to personnel with one or more of the following:

  - \[a\] security clearances for all information contained within the system;
  - \[b\] formal access authorizations for all information contained within the system;
  - \[c\] need for access to all information contained within the system; and/or
