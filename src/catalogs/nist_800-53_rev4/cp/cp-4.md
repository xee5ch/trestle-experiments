# cp-4 - \[Contingency Planning\] Contingency Plan Testing

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a\] Tests the contingency plan for the information system {{ insert: param, cp-4_prm_1 }} using {{ insert: param, cp-4_prm_2 }} to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the organizational readiness to execute the plan;

- \[b\] Reviews the contingency plan test results; and

- \[c\] Initiates corrective actions, if needed.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[a_obj\]

  - \[1\] defines tests to determine the effectiveness of the contingency plan and the organizational readiness to execute the plan;
  - \[2\] defines a frequency to test the contingency plan for the information system;
  - \[3\] tests the contingency plan for the information system with the organization-defined frequency, using organization-defined tests to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the organizational readiness to execute the plan;

- \[b_obj\] reviews the contingency plan test results; and

- \[c_obj\] initiates corrective actions, if needed.

## Control guidance

Methods for testing contingency plans to determine the effectiveness of the plans and to identify potential weaknesses in the plans include, for example, walk-through and tabletop exercises, checklists, simulations (parallel, full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Organizations conduct testing based on the continuity requirements in contingency plans and include a determination of the effects on organizational operations, assets, and individuals arising due to contingency operations. Organizations have flexibility and discretion in the breadth, depth, and timelines of corrective actions.
