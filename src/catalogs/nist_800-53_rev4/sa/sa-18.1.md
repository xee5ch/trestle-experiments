# sa-18.1 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Multiple Phases of SDLC

## Control Statement

The organization employs anti-tamper technologies and techniques during multiple phases in the system development life cycle including design, development, integration, operations, and maintenance.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization employs anti-tamper technologies and techniques during multiple phases in the system development life cycle including:

- \[1\] design;

- \[2\] development;

- \[3\] integration;

- \[4\] operations; and

- \[5\] maintenance.

## Control guidance

Organizations use a combination of hardware and software techniques for tamper resistance and detection. Organizations employ obfuscation and self-checking, for example, to make reverse engineering and modifications more difficult, time-consuming, and expensive for adversaries. Customization of information systems and system components can make substitutions easier to detect and therefore limit damage.
