# sa-15.4 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Threat Modeling / Vulnerability Analysis

## Control Statement

The organization requires that developers perform threat modeling and a vulnerability analysis for the information system at {{ insert: param, sa-15.4_prm_1 }} that:

- \[a\] Uses {{ insert: param, sa-15.4_prm_2 }};

- \[b\] Employs {{ insert: param, sa-15.4_prm_3 }}; and

- \[c\] Produces evidence that meets {{ insert: param, sa-15.4_prm_4 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[1\] defines the breadth of threat modeling and vulnerability analysis to be performed by developers for the information system;

- \[2\] defines the depth of threat modeling and vulnerability analysis to be performed by developers for the information system;

- \[3\] defines information concerning impact, environment of operations, known or assumed threats, and acceptable risk levels to be used in threat modeling and vulnerability analysis;

- \[4\] defines tools and methods to be employed in threat modeling and vulnerability analysis;

- \[5\] defines acceptance criteria for evidence produced from threat modeling and vulnerability analysis;

- \[6\] requires that developers perform threat modeling and a vulnerability analysis for the information system at the organization-defined breadth/depth that:

  - \[6\] uses organization-defined information concerning impact, environment of operations, known or assumed threats, and acceptable risk levels;
  - \[6\] employs organization-defined tools and methods; and
  - \[6\] produces evidence that meets organization-defined acceptance criteria.
