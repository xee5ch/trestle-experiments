# sa-10.4 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Trusted Generation

## Control Statement

The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to employ tools for comparing newly generated versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and software/firmware source and object code with previous versions.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to employ tools for comparing newly generated versions of:

- \[1\] security-relevant hardware descriptions with previous versions; and

- \[2\] software/firmware source and object code with previous versions.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement addresses changes to hardware, software, and firmware components between versions during development. In contrast, SA-10 (1) and SA-10 (3) allow organizations to detect unauthorized changes to hardware, software, and firmware components through the use of tools, techniques, and/or mechanisms provided by developers.
