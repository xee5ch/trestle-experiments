# au-5.2 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Real-time Alerts

## Control Statement

The information system provides an alert in {{ insert: param, au-5.2_prm_1 }} to {{ insert: param, au-5.2_prm_2 }} when the following audit failure events occur: {{ insert: param, au-5.2_prm_3 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[1\] the organization defines audit failure events requiring real-time alerts;

- \[2\] the organization defines:

  - \[a\] personnel to be alerted when organization-defined audit failure events requiring real-time alerts occur;
  - \[b\] roles to be alerted when organization-defined audit failure events requiring real-time alerts occur; and/or
  - \[c\] locations to be alerted when organization-defined audit failure events requiring real-time alerts occur;

- \[3\] the organization defines the real-time period within which the information system is to provide an alert to the organization-defined personnel, roles, and/or locations when the organization-defined audit failure events requiring real-time alerts occur; and

- \[4\] the information system provides an alert within the organization-defined real-time period to the organization-defined personnel, roles, and/or locations when organization-defined audit failure events requiring real-time alerts occur.

## Control guidance

Alerts provide organizations with urgent messages. Real-time alerts provide these messages at information technology speed (i.e., the time from event detection to alert occurs in seconds or less).
