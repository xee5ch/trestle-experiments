# si-2.5 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Automatic Software / Firmware Updates

## Control Statement

The organization installs {{ insert: param, si-2.5_prm_1 }} automatically to {{ insert: param, si-2.5_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[1\]

  - \[a\] defines information system components requiring security-relevant software updates to be automatically installed;
  - \[b\] defines information system components requiring security-relevant firmware updates to be automatically installed;

- \[2\]

  - \[a\] defines security-relevant software updates to be automatically installed to organization-defined information system components;
  - \[b\] defines security-relevant firmware updates to be automatically installed to organization-defined information system components;

- \[3\]

  - \[a\] installs organization-defined security-relevant software updates automatically to organization-defined information system components; and
  - \[b\] installs organization-defined security-relevant firmware updates automatically to organization-defined information system components.

## Control guidance

Due to information system integrity and availability concerns, organizations give careful consideration to the methodology used to carry out automatic updates. Organizations must balance the need to ensure that the updates are installed as soon as possible with the need to maintain configuration management and with any mission or operational impacts that automatic updates might impose.
