# si-7.1 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Integrity Checks

## Control Statement

The information system performs an integrity check of {{ insert: param, si-7.1_prm_1 }} {{ insert: param, si-7.1_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[1\] the organization defines:

  - \[a\] software requiring integrity checks to be performed;
  - \[b\] firmware requiring integrity checks to be performed;
  - \[c\] information requiring integrity checks to be performed;

- \[2\] the organization defines transitional states or security-relevant events requiring integrity checks of organization-defined:

  - \[a\] software;
  - \[b\] firmware;
  - \[c\] information;

- \[3\] the organization defines a frequency with which to perform an integrity check of organization-defined:

  - \[a\] software;
  - \[b\] firmware;
  - \[c\] information;

- \[4\] the information system performs an integrity check of organization-defined software, firmware, and information one or more of the following:

  - \[a\] at startup;
  - \[b\] at organization-defined transitional states or security-relevant events; and/or
  - \[c\] with the organization-defined frequency.

## Control guidance

Security-relevant events include, for example, the identification of a new threat to which organizational information systems are susceptible, and the installation of new hardware, software, or firmware. Transitional states include, for example, system startup, restart, shutdown, and abort.
