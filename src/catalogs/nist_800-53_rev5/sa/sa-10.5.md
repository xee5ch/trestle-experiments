# sa-10.5 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Mapping Integrity for Version Control

## Control Statement

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to maintain the integrity of the mapping between the master build data (hardware drawings and software/firmware code) describing the current version of security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware and the on-site master copy of the data for the current version.

## Control guidance

Mapping integrity for version control addresses changes to hardware, software, and firmware components during initial development and during system development life cycle updates. Maintaining the integrity between the master copies of security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware (including designs and source code) and the equivalent data in master copies in operational environments is essential to ensure the availability of organizational systems supporting critical missions and business functions.
