# sa-17 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Developer Security Architecture and Design

## Control Statement

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to produce a design specification and security architecture that:

- \[a\] Is consistent with the organization’s security architecture that is an integral part the organization’s enterprise architecture;

- \[b\] Accurately and completely describes the required security functionality, and the allocation of controls among physical and logical components; and

- \[c\] Expresses how individual security functions, mechanisms, and services work together to provide required security capabilities and a unified approach to protection.

## Control guidance

Developer security architecture and design is directed at external developers, although it could also be applied to internal (in-house) development. In contrast, PL-8 is directed at internal developers to ensure that organizations develop a security architecture and that the architecture is integrated with the enterprise architecture. The distinction between SA-17 and PL-8 is especially important when organizations outsource the development of systems, system components, or system services, and when there is a requirement to demonstrate consistency with the enterprise architecture and security architecture of the organization. [ISO 15408-2], [ISO 15408-3], and [SP 800-160 v1] provide information on security architecture and design, including formal policy models, security-relevant components, formal and informal correspondence, conceptually simple design, and structuring for least privilege and testing.
