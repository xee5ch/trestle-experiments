# sa-8.29 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Repeatable and Documented Procedures

## Control Statement

Implement the security design principle of repeatable and documented procedures in {{ insert: param, sa-8.29_prm_1 }}.

## Control guidance

The principle of repeatable and documented procedures states that the techniques and methods employed to construct a system component permits the same component to be completely and correctly reconstructed at a later time. Repeatable and documented procedures support the development of a component that is identical to the component created earlier that may be in widespread use. In the case of other system artifacts (e.g., documentation and testing results), repeatability supports consistency and ability to inspect the artifacts. Repeatable and documented procedures can be introduced at various stages within the system development life cycle and can contribute to the ability to evaluate assurance claims for the system. Examples include systematic procedures for code development and review; procedures for configuration management of development tools and system artifacts; and procedures for system delivery.
