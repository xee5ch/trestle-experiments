# sa-4.3 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Development Methods, Techniques, and Practices

## Control Statement

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to demonstrate the use of a system development life cycle process that includes:

- \[a\]  {{ insert: param, sa-4.3_prm_1 }};

- \[b\]  {{ insert: param, sa-4.3_prm_2 }} engineering methods];

- \[c\]  {{ insert: param, sa-4.3_prm_3 }}.

## Control guidance

Following a system development life cycle that includes state-of-the-practice software development methods, systems engineering methods, systems security and privacy engineering methods, and quality control processes helps to reduce the number and severity of the latent errors within systems, system components, and system services. Reducing the number and severity of such errors reduces the number of vulnerabilities in those systems, components, and services. Transparency in the methods developers select and implement for systems engineering, systems security and privacy engineering, software development, component and system assessments, and quality control processes provide an increased level of assurance in the trustworthiness of the system, system component, or system service being acquired.
