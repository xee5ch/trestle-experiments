# sa-22 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Unsupported System Components

## Control Statement

- \[a\] Replace system components when support for the components is no longer available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer; or

- \[b\] Provide the following options for alternative sources for continued support for unsupported components {{ insert: param, sa-22_prm_1 }}.

## Control guidance

Support for system components includes software patches, firmware updates, replacement parts, and maintenance contracts. Unsupported components, for example, when vendors no longer provide critical software patches or product updates, provide an opportunity for adversaries to exploit weaknesses in the installed components. Exceptions to replacing unsupported system components include systems that provide critical mission or business capability where newer technologies are not available or where the systems are so isolated that installing replacement components is not an option. Alternative sources for support address the need to provide continued support for system components that are no longer supported by the original manufacturers, developers, or vendors when such components remain essential to organizational mission and business operations. If necessary, organizations can establish in-house support by developing customized patches for critical software components or alternatively, obtain the services of external providers who through contractual relationships, provide ongoing support for the designated unsupported components. Such contractual relationships can include Open Source Software value-added vendors.
