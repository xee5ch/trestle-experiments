# sa-10.2 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Alternative Configuration Management

## Control Statement

Provide an alternate configuration management process using organizational personnel in the absence of a dedicated developer configuration management team.

## Control guidance

Alternate configuration management processes may be required, for example, when organizations use commercial off-the-shelf information technology products. Alternate configuration management processes include organizational personnel that review and approve proposed changes to systems, system components, and system services; and that conduct security and privacy impact analyses prior to the implementation of changes to systems, components, or services.
