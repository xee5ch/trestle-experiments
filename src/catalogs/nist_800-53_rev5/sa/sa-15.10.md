# sa-15.10 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Incident Response Plan

## Control Statement

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to provide, implement, and test an incident response plan.

## Control guidance

The incident response plan provided by developers may be incorporated into organizational incident response plans. Developer incident response information provides information that is not readily available to organizations. Such information may be extremely helpful, for example, when organizations respond to vulnerabilities in commercial off-the-shelf products.
