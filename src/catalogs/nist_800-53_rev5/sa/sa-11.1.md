# sa-11.1 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Static Code Analysis

## Control Statement

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to employ static code analysis tools to identify common flaws and document the results of the analysis.

## Control guidance

Static code analysis provides a technology and methodology for security reviews and includes checking for weaknesses in the code and checking for incorporation of libraries or other included code with known vulnerabilities or that are out-of-date and not supported. Static code analysis can be used to identify vulnerabilities and to enforce secure coding practices and Static code analysis is most effective when used early in the development process, when each code change can be automatically scanned for potential weaknesses. Static code analysis can provide clear remediation guidance along with defects to enable developers to fix such defects. Evidence of correct implementation of static analysis include aggregate defect density for critical defect types; evidence that defects were inspected by developers or security professionals; and evidence that defects were remediated. A high density of ignored findings, commonly referred to as false positives, indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or the analysis tool. In such cases, organizations weigh the validity of the evidence against evidence from other sources.
