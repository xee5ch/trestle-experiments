Organizations apply any conditions or protections that may be necessary for specific categories of personally identifiable information. These conditions may be required by laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, or guidelines.

Organizations consult with the senior agency official for privacy and legal counsel regarding any protections that may be necessary.
