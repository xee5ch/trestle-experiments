## Control guidance

The [PRIVACT] establishes a set of requirements for federal and non-federal agencies when they engage in a matching program. In general, a matching program is a computerized comparison of records from two or more automated [PRIVACT] systems of records, or an automated system of records and automated records maintained by a non-Federal agency (or agent thereof). A matching program either pertains to Federal benefit programs or Federal personnel or payroll records. A Federal benefit match is performed for purposes of determining or verifying eligibility for payments under Federal benefit programs, or recouping payments or delinquent debts under Federal benefit programs. A matching program involves not just the matching activity itself, but also the investigative follow-up and ultimate action, if any.
