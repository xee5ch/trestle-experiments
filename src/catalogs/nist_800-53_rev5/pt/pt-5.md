# pt-5 - \[Personally Identifiable Information Processing and Transparency\] Consent

## Control Statement

Implement {{ insert: param, pt-5_prm_1 }} for individuals to consent to the processing of their personally identifiable information prior to its collection that:

- \[a\] Facilitate individualsâ€™ informed decision-making; and

- \[b\] Provide a means for individuals to decline consent.

## Control guidance

Consent allows individuals to participate in the decision-making about the processing of their information and transfers some of the risk that arises from the processing of personally identifiable information from the organization to an individual. Organizations consider whether other controls may more effectively mitigate privacy risk either alone or in conjunction with consent. Consent may be required by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, or guidelines. Otherwise, when selecting this control, organizations consider whether individuals can be reasonably expected to understand and accept the privacy risks arising from their authorization. Organizations also consider any demographic or contextual factors that may influence the understanding or behavior of individuals with respect to the data actions carried out by the system or organization. When soliciting consent from individuals, organizations consider the appropriate mechanism for obtaining consent, including how to properly authenticate and identity proof individuals and how to obtain consent through electronic means. In addition, organizations consider providing a mechanism for individuals to revoke consent once it has been provided, as appropriate. Finally, organizations consider usability factors to help individuals understand the risks being accepted when providing consent, including the use of plain language and avoiding technical jargon.
