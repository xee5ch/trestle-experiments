## Control guidance

Media downgrading applies to digital and non-digital media, subject to release outside the organization, whether the media is considered removable or not removable. The downgrading process, when applied to system media, removes information from the media, typically by security category or classification level, such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Downgrading of media includes redacting information to enable wider release and distribution. Downgrading also ensures that empty space on the media is devoid of information.
