## Control guidance

Retaining critical or sensitive information (e.g., classified information or controlled unclassified information) for longer than it is needed makes it an increasing valuable and enticing target for adversaries. Keeping such information available for the minimum period of time needed for mission accomplishment reduces the opportunity for adversaries to compromise, capture, and exfiltrate that information.
