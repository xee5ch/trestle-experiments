# si-4.12 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Automated Organization-generated Alerts

## Control Statement

Alert {{ insert: param, si-4.12_prm_1 }} using {{ insert: param, si-4.12_prm_2 }} when the following indications of inappropriate or unusual activities with security or privacy implications occur: {{ insert: param, si-4.12_prm_3 }}.

## Control guidance

Organizational personnel on the system alert notification list include system administrators, mission or business owners, system owners, senior agency information security officer, senior agency official for privacy, system security officers, or privacy officers. This control enhancement focuses on the security alerts generated by organizations and transmitted using automated means. In contrast to the alerts generated by systems in SI-4(5) that focus on information sources that are internal to the systems such as audit records, the sources of information for this enhancement focus on other entities such as suspicious activity reports and reports on potential insider threats.
