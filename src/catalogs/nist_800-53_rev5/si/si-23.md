# si-23 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Information Fragmentation

## Control Statement

Based on {{ insert: param, si-23_prm_1 }}:

- \[a\] Fragment the following information: {{ insert: param, si-23_prm_2 }}; and

- \[b\] Distribute the fragmented information across the following systems or system components: {{ insert: param, si-23_prm_3 }}.

## Control guidance

One major objective of the advanced persistent threat is to exfiltrate sensitive and valuable information. Once exfiltrated, there is generally no way for the organization to recover the lost information. Therefore, organizations may consider taking the information and dividing it into disparate elements and then distributing those elements across multiple systems or system components and locations. Such actions will increase the adversary’s work factor to capture and exfiltrate the desired information and in so doing, increase the probability of detection. The fragmentation of information also impacts the organization’s ability to access the information in a timely manner. The extent of the fragmentation would likely be dictated by the sensitivity (and value) of the information, threat intelligence information received, and if data tainting is used (i.e., data tainting derived information about exfiltration of some information could result in the fragmentation of the remaining information).
