# si-19.5 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Statistical Disclosure Control

## Control Statement

Manipulate numerical data, contingency tables, and statistical findings so that no person or organization is identifiable in the results of the analysis.

## Control guidance

Many types of statistical analyses can result in the disclosure of information about individuals even if only summary information is provided. For example, if a school publishes a monthly table with the number of minority students, and in January the school reports that it has 10-19 such students, but in March it reports that it has 20-29 students, then it can be inferred that the student who enrolled in February was a minority.
