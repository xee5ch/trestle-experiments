## Control Statement

## Control guidance

Information management and retention requirements cover the full life cycle of information, in some cases extending beyond system disposal.

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) provides federal policy and guidance on records retention. If organizations have a records management office, consider coordinating with records management personnel.
