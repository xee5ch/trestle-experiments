# si-19.7 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Validated Software

## Control Statement

Perform de-identification using validated algorithms and software that is validated to implement the algorithms.

## Control guidance

Algorithms that appear to remove personally identifiable information from a dataset may in fact leave information that is personally identifiable or data that are re-identifiable. Software that is claimed to implement a validated algorithm may contain bugs or may implement a different algorithm. Software may de-identify one type of data, for example, integers, but not another type of data, for example, floating point numbers. For these reasons, de-identification is performed using algorithms and software that are validated.
