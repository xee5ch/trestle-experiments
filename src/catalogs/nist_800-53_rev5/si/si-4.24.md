## Control Statement

## Control guidance

Indicators of compromise (IOC) are forensic artifacts from intrusions that are identified on organizational systems at the host or network level. IOCs provide valuable information on systems that have been compromised. IOCs can include the creation of registry key values. IOCs for network traffic include Universal Resource Locator or protocol elements that indicate malicious code command and control servers. The rapid distribution and adoption of IOCs can improve information security by reducing the time that systems and organizations are vulnerable to the same exploit or attack. Threat indicators, signatures, tactics, techniques and procedures, and other indicators of compromise may be available via government and non-government cooperatives including Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Information Sharing Program, and CERT Coordination Center.
