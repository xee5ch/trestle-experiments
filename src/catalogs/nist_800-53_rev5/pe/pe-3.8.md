## Control guidance

An access control vestibule, or mantrap, is part of a physical access control system that typically provides a space between two sets of interlocking doors. Mantraps are designed to prevent unauthorized individuals from following authorized individuals into facilities with controlled access. This activity, also known as piggybacking or tailgating, results in unauthorized access to the facility. Mantraps can also be used to limit the number of individuals entering controlled access points and to provide containment areas to verify credentials. Mantraps can be fully automated, controlling the opening and closing of the interlocking doors, or partially automated using security guards to control the number of individuals entering the mantrap.
