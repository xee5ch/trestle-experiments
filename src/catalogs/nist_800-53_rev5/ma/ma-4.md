# ma-4 - \[Maintenance\] Nonlocal Maintenance

## Control Statement

- \[a\] Approve and monitor nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities;

- \[b\] Allow the use of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic tools only as consistent with organizational policy and documented in the security plan for the system;

- \[c\] Employ strong authenticators in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions;

- \[d\] Maintain records for nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities; and

- \[e\] Terminate session and network connections when nonlocal maintenance is completed.

## Control guidance

Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network or an internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities carried out by individuals physically present at the system and not communicating across a network connection. Authentication techniques used in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access requirements in IA-2. Strong authentication requires authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and employ multifactor authentication. Strong authenticators include PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or biometric. Enforcing requirements in MA-4 is accomplished in part by other controls.
