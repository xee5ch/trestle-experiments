## Control Statement

- \[a\] Approve, control, and monitor the use of system maintenance tools; and

- \[b\] Review previously approved system maintenance tools {{ insert: param, ma-3_prm_1 }}.

## Control guidance

Approving, controlling, monitoring, and reviewing maintenance tools are intended to address security-related issues associated with maintenance tools that are not within system boundaries but are used specifically for diagnostic and repair actions on organizational systems. Organizations have flexibility in determining roles for approval of maintenance tools and how that approval is documented. Periodic review of maintenance tools facilitates withdrawal of the approval for outdated, unsupported, irrelevant, or no-longer-used tools. Maintenance tools can include hardware, software, and firmware items. Such tools can be vehicles for transporting malicious code, intentionally or unintentionally, into a facility and subsequently into systems. Maintenance tools can include hardware and software diagnostic test equipment and packet sniffers. The hardware and software components that support system maintenance and are a part of the system, including the software implementing “ping,” “ls,” “ipconfig,” or the hardware and software implementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet switch, are not addressed by maintenance tools.
