# sc-17 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Public Key Infrastructure Certificates

## Control Statement

- \[a\] Issue public key certificates under an {{ insert: param, sc-17_prm_1 }} or obtain public key certificates from an approved service provider; and

- \[b\] Include only approved trust anchors in trust stores or certificate stores managed by the organization.

## Control guidance

This control addresses certificates with visibility external to organizational systems and certificates related to internal operations of systems, for example, application-specific time services. In cryptographic systems with a hierarchical structure, a trust anchor is an authoritative source (i.e., a certificate authority) for which trust is assumed and not derived. A root certificate for a PKI system is an example of a trust anchor. A trust store or certificate store maintains a list of trusted root certificates.
