# sc-47 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Communications Path Diversity

## Control Statement

Establish {{ insert: param, sc-47_prm_1 }} for system operations organizational command and control.

## Control guidance

An incident, whether adversarial- or nonadversarial-based, can disrupt established communications paths used for system operations and organizational command and control. The inability of organizational officials to obtain timely information about disruptions or to provide timely direction to operational elements can impact the organization’s ability to respond in a timely manner to such incidents. Establishing alternate communications paths for command and control purposes, including designating alternative decision makers if primary decision makers are unavailable and establishing the extent and limitations of their actions, can greatly facilitate the organization’s ability to continue to operate and take appropriate actions during an incident.
