# sc-31.3 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Measure Bandwidth in Operational Environments

## Control Statement

Measure the bandwidth of {{ insert: param, sc-31.3_prm_1 }} in the operational environment of the system.

## Control guidance

Measuring covert channel bandwidth in specified operational environments helps organizations to determine how much information can be covertly leaked before such leakage adversely affects missions or business functions. Covert channel bandwidth may be significantly different when measured in those settings that are independent of the specific environments of operation, including laboratories or system development environments.
