# sc-42 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Sensor Capability and Data

## Control Statement

- \[a\] Prohibit the remote activation of environmental sensing capabilities on organizational systems or system components with the following exceptions: {{ insert: param, sc-42_prm_1 }}; and

- \[b\] Provide an explicit indication of sensor use to {{ insert: param, sc-42_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

Sensor capability and data applies to types of systems or system components characterized as mobile devices, for example, smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices often include sensors that can collect and record data regarding the environment where the system is in use. Sensors that are embedded within mobile devices include cameras, microphones, Global Positioning System (GPS) mechanisms, and accelerometers. While the sensors on mobiles devices provide an important function, if activated covertly such devices can potentially provide a means for adversaries to learn valuable information about individuals and organizations. For example, remotely activating the GPS function on a mobile device could provide an adversary with the ability to track the specific movements of an individual.
