# sc-40.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Electromagnetic Interference

## Control Statement

Implement cryptographic mechanisms that achieve {{ insert: param, sc-40.1_prm_1 }} against the effects of intentional electromagnetic interference.

## Control guidance

Implementation of cryptographic mechanisms for electromagnetic interference protects against intentional jamming that might deny or impair communications by ensuring that wireless spread spectrum waveforms used to provide anti-jam protection are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. The implementation of cryptographic mechanisms may also coincidentally mitigate the effects of unintentional jamming due to interference from legitimate transmitters sharing the same spectrum. Mission requirements, projected threats, concept of operations, and applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, and standards determine levels of wireless link availability, cryptography needed, or performance.
