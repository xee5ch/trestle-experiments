# sc-7.29 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Separate Subnets to Isolate Functions

## Control Statement

Implement {{ insert: param, sc-7.29_prm_1 }} separate subnetworks to isolate the following critical system components and functions: {{ insert: param, sc-7.29_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

Separating critical system components and functions from other noncritical system components and functions through separate subnetworks may be necessary to reduce the susceptibility to a catastrophic or debilitating breach or compromise resulting in system failure. For example, physically separating the command and control function from the entertainment function through separate subnetworks in a commercial aircraft provides an increased level of assurance in the trustworthiness of critical system functions.
