# sc-30.2 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Randomness

## Control Statement

Employ {{ insert: param, sc-30.2_prm_1 }} to introduce randomness into organizational operations and assets.

## Control guidance

Randomness introduces increased levels of uncertainty for adversaries regarding the actions organizations take in defending their systems against attacks. Such actions may impede the ability of adversaries to correctly target information resources of organizations supporting critical missions or business functions. Uncertainty may also cause adversaries to hesitate before initiating attacks or continuing the attacks. Misdirection techniques involving randomness include performing certain routine actions at different times of day, employing different information technologies, using different suppliers, and rotating roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel.
