# sc-34 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Non-modifiable Executable Programs

## Control Statement

For {{ insert: param, sc-34_prm_1 }}, load and execute:

- \[a\] The operating environment from hardware-enforced, read-only media; and

- \[b\] The following applications from hardware-enforced, read-only media: {{ insert: param, sc-34_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

The operating environment for a system contains the code that hosts applications, including operating systems, executives, or virtual machine monitors (i.e., hypervisors). It can also include certain applications running directly on hardware platforms. Hardware-enforced, read-only media include Compact Disk-Recordable (CD-R) and Digital Versatile Disk-Recordable (DVD-R) disk drives and one-time programmable read-only memory. The use of non-modifiable storage ensures the integrity of software from the point of creation of the read-only image. Use of reprogrammable read-only memory can be accepted as read-only media provided integrity can be adequately protected from the point of initial writing to the insertion of the memory into the system; and there are reliable hardware protections against reprogramming the memory while installed in organizational systems.
