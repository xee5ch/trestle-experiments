# sc-40.4 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Signal Parameter Identification

## Control Statement

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the identification of {{ insert: param, sc-40.4_prm_1 }} by using the transmitter signal parameters.

## Control guidance

Radio fingerprinting techniques identify the unique signal parameters of transmitters to fingerprint such transmitters for purposes of tracking and mission or user identification. Implementation of cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the identification of wireless transmitters protects against the unique identification of wireless transmitters for purposes of intelligence exploitation by ensuring that anti-fingerprinting alterations to signal parameters are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. It also provides anonymity when required.
