# sc-7.16 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Prevent Discovery of Components and Devices

## Control Statement

Prevent the discovery of specific system components that represent a managed interface.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement protects network addresses of system components that are part of managed interfaces from discovery through common tools and techniques used to identify devices on networks. Network addresses are not available for discovery, requiring prior knowledge for access. Preventing discovery of components and devices can be accomplished by not publishing network addresses, using network address translation, or not entering the addresses in domain name systems. Another prevention technique is to periodically change network addresses.
