# sc-6 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Resource Availability

## Control Statement

Protect the availability of resources by allocating {{ insert: param, sc-6_prm_1 }} by {{ insert: param, sc-6_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

Priority protection prevents lower-priority processes from delaying or interfering with the system servicing higher-priority processes. Quotas prevent users or processes from obtaining more than predetermined amounts of resources. This control does not apply to system components for which there are only single users or roles.
