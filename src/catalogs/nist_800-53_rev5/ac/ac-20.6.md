# ac-20.6 - \[Access Control\] Non-organizationally Owned Systems â€” Prohibited Use

## Control Statement

Prohibit the use of non-organizationally owned systems or system components to process, store, or transmit organizational information.

## Control guidance

Non-organizationally owned systems or system components include systems or system components owned by other organizations and personally owned devices. There are potential risks to using non-organizationally owned systems or system components. In some cases, the risk is sufficiently high as to prohibit such use. In other cases, the use of such systems or system components may be allowed but restricted in some way (see AC-20(4)).
