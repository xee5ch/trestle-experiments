# ac-17.10 - \[Access Control\] Authenticate Remote Commands

## Control Statement

Implement {{ insert: param, ac-17.10_prm_1 }} to authenticate {{ insert: param, ac-17.10_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

Authenticating remote commands protects against unauthorized commands and the replay of authorized commands. The capability to authenticate remote commands is important for remote systems whose loss, malfunction, misdirection, or exploitation would have immediate or serious consequences, including injury or death; property damage; loss of high value assets; failure of missions or business functions; or compromise of classified or controlled unclassified information. Authentication controls for remote commands ensure that systems accept and execute commands in the order intended, execute only authorized commands, and reject unauthorized commands. Cryptographic mechanisms can be used, for example, to authenticate remote commands.
