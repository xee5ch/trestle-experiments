# ac-2.3 - \[Access Control\] Disable Accounts

## Control Statement

Disable accounts when the accounts:

- \[a\] Have expired;

- \[b\] Are no longer associated with a user or individual;

- \[c\] Are in violation of organizational policy; or

- \[d\] Have been inactive for {{ insert: param, ac-2.3_prm_1 }}.

## Control guidance

Disabling expired, inactive, or otherwise anomalous accounts supports the concept of least privilege and least functionality which reduces the attack surface of the system.
