# ac-16.8 - \[Access Control\] Association Techniques and Technologies

## Control Statement

Implement {{ insert: param, ac-16.8_prm_1 }} with {{ insert: param, ac-16.8_prm_2 }} in associating security and privacy attributes to information.

## Control guidance

The association of security and privacy attributes to information within systems is important for conducting automated access enforcement and flow enforcement actions. The association of such attributes to information (i.e., binding) can be accomplished with technologies and techniques providing different levels of assurance. For example, systems can bind attributes to information cryptographically using digital signatures supporting cryptographic keys protected by hardware devices (sometimes known as hardware roots of trust).
