# ac-4.26 - \[Access Control\] Audit Filtering Actions

## Control Statement

When transferring information between different security domains, record and audit content filtering actions and results for the information being filtered.

## Control guidance

Content filtering is the process of inspecting information as it traverses a cross domain solution and determines if the information meets a pre-defined policy. Content filtering actions and results of filtering actions are recorded for individual messages to ensure the correct filter actions were applied. Content filter reports are used to assist in troubleshooting actions, for example, determining why message content was modified and/or why it failed the filtering process. Audit events are defined in AU-2. Audit records are generated in AU-12.
