# ac-6.9 - \[Access Control\] Log Use of Privileged Functions

## Control Statement

Audit the execution of privileged functions.

## Control guidance

The misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Capturing the use of privileged functions in audit logs is one way to detect such misuse, and in doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat.
