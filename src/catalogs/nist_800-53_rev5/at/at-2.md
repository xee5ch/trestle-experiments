## Control guidance

Organizations provide foundational and advanced levels of awareness training to system users, including measures to test the knowledge level of users. Organizations determine the content of awareness training based on specific organizational requirements, the systems to which personnel have authorized access, and work environments (e.g., telework). The content includes an understanding of the need for security and privacy and actions by users to maintain security and personal privacy and to respond to suspected incidents. The content addresses the need for operations security and the handling of personally identifiable information. Awareness techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security and privacy reminders, displaying logon screen messages, generating email advisories or notices from organizational officials, and conducting awareness events. Awareness training after the initial training described in AT-2a.1, is conducted at a minimum frequency consistent with applicable laws, directives, regulations, and policies. Subsequent awareness training may be satisfied by one or more short ad hoc sessions and include topical information on recent attack schemes; changes to organizational security and privacy policies; revised security and privacy expectations; or a subset of topics from the initial training. Updating awareness training on a regular basis helps to ensure the content remains relevant and effective.
