# ir-2 - \[Incident Response\] Incident Response Training

## Control Statement

Provide incident response training to system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities:

- \[a\] Within {{ insert: param, ir-2_prm_1 }} of assuming an incident response role or responsibility or acquiring system access;

- \[b\] When required by system changes; and

- \[c\]  {{ insert: param, ir-2_prm_2 }} thereafter.

## Control guidance

Incident response training is associated with assigned roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure the appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For example, users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle incidents; and finally, incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, data collection techniques, reporting, system recovery, and system restoration. Incident response training includes user training in identifying and reporting suspicious activities from external and internal sources. Incident response training for users may be provided as part of AT-2 or AT-3.
