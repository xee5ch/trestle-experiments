# ra-3.4 - \[Risk Assessment\] Predictive Cyber Analytics

## Control Statement

Employ the following advanced automation and analytics capabilities to predict and identify risks to {{ insert: param, ra-3.4_prm_1 }}: {{ insert: param, ra-3.4_prm_2 }}.

## Control guidance

A properly resourced Security Operations Center (SOC) or Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT) may be overwhelmed by the volume of information generated by the proliferation of security tools and appliances unless it employs advanced automation and analytics to analyze the data. Advanced automation and analytics capabilities are typically supported by artificial intelligence concepts including, machine learning. Examples include Automated Threat Discovery and Response (which includes broad-based collection, context-based analysis, and adaptive response capabilities), Automated Workflow Operations, and Machine Assisted Decision tools. Note, however, that sophisticated adversaries may be able to extract information related to analytic parameters and retrain the machine learning to classify malicious activity as benign. Accordingly, machine learning is augmented by human monitoring to ensure sophisticated adversaries are not able to conceal their activity.
