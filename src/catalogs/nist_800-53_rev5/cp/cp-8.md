# cp-8 - \[Contingency Planning\] Telecommunications Services

## Control Statement

Establish alternate telecommunications services, including necessary agreements to permit the resumption of {{ insert: param, cp-8_prm_1 }} for essential missions and business functions within {{ insert: param, cp-8_prm_2 }} when the primary telecommunications capabilities are unavailable at either the primary or alternate processing or storage sites.

## Control guidance

This control applies to telecommunications services (for data and voice) for primary and alternate processing and storage sites. Alternate telecommunications services reflect the continuity requirements in contingency plans to maintain essential missions and business functions despite the loss of primary telecommunications services. Organizations may specify different time-periods for primary or alternate sites. Alternate telecommunications services include additional organizational or commercial ground-based circuits or lines or the use of satellites in lieu of ground-based communications. Organizations consider factors such as availability, quality of service, and access when entering into alternate telecommunications agreements.
