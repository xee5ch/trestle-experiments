Organizations should use the webpage to inform the public about privacy policies and practices, including privacy impact assessments, system of records notices, computer matching notices and agreements, [PRIVACT] exemption and implementation rules, instructions for individuals making an access or amendment request, privacy reports, privacy policies, email addresses for questions/complaints, blogs, and periodic publications.
