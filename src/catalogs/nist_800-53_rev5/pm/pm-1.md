## Control guidance

An information security program plan is a formal document that provides an overview of the security requirements for an organization-wide information security program and describes the program management controls and common controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. Information security program plans can be represented in single documents or compilations of documents. Information security program plans document the program management and common controls. The plans provide sufficient information about the controls (including specification of parameters for assignment and selection statements explicitly or by reference) to enable implementations that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and a determination of the risk to be incurred if the plans are implemented as intended. Program management controls are generally implemented at the organization level and are essential for managing the organization’s information security program. Program management controls are distinct from common, system-specific, and hybrid controls because program management controls are independent of any particular information system. The individual system security plans and the organization-wide information security program plan together, provide complete coverage for the security controls employed within the organization. Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organization’s information security program plan unless the controls are included in a separate security plan for a system. The organization-wide information security program plan indicates which separate security plans contain descriptions of common controls.
