## Control Statement

Offload {{ insert: param, pm-7.1_prm_1 }} to other systems, system components, or an external provider.

## Control guidance

Not every function or service a system provides is essential to an organization’s missions or business operations. Printing or copying is an example of a non-essential but supporting service for an organization. Whenever feasible, such supportive but non-essential functions or services are not co-located with the functions or services supporting essential missions or business operations. Maintaining such functions on the same system or system component increases the attack surface of the organization’s mission essential functions or services. Moving supportive but non-essential functions to a non-critical system, system component, or external provider can also increase efficiency by putting those functions or services under the control of individuals or providers who are subject matter experts in the functions or services.
