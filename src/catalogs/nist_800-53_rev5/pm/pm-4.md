## Control guidance

The plan of action and milestones is a key document in the information security and privacy programs of organizations and is subject to reporting requirements established by the Office of Management and Budget. Organizations view plans of action and milestones from an organization-wide perspective, prioritizing risk response actions and ensuring consistency with the goals and objectives of the organization. Plan of action and milestones updates are based on findings from control assessments and continuous monitoring activities. There can be multiple levels of plan of action and milestones documents corresponding to the information system level, mission/business process level, and organizational/governance level. While the plan of action and milestones is required for federal organizations, any type of organization can help reduce risk by documenting and tracking planned remediations. Specific guidance on plans of action and milestones for organizational systems in described in CA-5.
