# ia-8.2 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Acceptance of External Credentials

## Control Statement

Accept only external credentials that are NIST-compliant.

## Control guidance

Acceptance of only NIST-compliant external credentials applies to organizational systems that are accessible to the public (e.g., public-facing websites). External credentials are those credentials issued by nonfederal government entities. External credentials are certified as compliant with [SP 800-63-3] by an approved accreditation authority. Approved external credentials meet or exceed the set of minimum federal government-wide technical, security, privacy, and organizational maturity requirements. Meeting or exceeding federal requirements allows federal government relying parties to trust external credentials at their approved assurance levels.
