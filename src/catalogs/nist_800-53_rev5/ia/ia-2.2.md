# ia-2.2 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Multifactor Authentication to Non-privileged Accounts

## Control Statement

Implement multifactor authentication for access to non-privileged accounts.

## Control guidance

Multifactor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The authentication factors are defined as follows: something you know (e.g., a personal identification number (PIN)); something you have (e.g., a physical authenticator or cryptographic private key stored in hardware or software); or something you are (e.g., a biometric). Multifactor authentication solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware authenticators providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card or the DoD Common Access Card. In addition to authenticating users at the system level, organizations may also employ authentication mechanisms at the application level, at their discretion, to provide increased information security. Regardless of the type of access, privileged accounts are authenticated using multifactor options appropriate for the level of risk. Organizations can provide additional security measures, such as additional or more rigorous authentication mechanisms, for specific types of access.
