# cm-3 - \[Configuration Management\] Configuration Change Control

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a\] Determines the types of changes to the information system that are configuration-controlled;

- \[b\] Reviews proposed configuration-controlled changes to the information system and approves or disapproves such changes with explicit consideration for security impact analyses;

- \[c\] Documents configuration change decisions associated with the information system;

- \[d\] Implements approved configuration-controlled changes to the information system;

- \[e\] Retains records of configuration-controlled changes to the information system for {{ insert: param, cm-3_prm_1 }};

- \[f\] Audits and reviews activities associated with configuration-controlled changes to the information system; and

- \[g\] Coordinates and provides oversight for configuration change control activities through {{ insert: param, cm-3_prm_2 }} that convenes {{ insert: param, cm-3_prm_3 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[a_obj\] determines the type of changes to the information system that must be configuration-controlled;

- \[b_obj\] reviews proposed configuration-controlled changes to the information system and approves or disapproves such changes with explicit consideration for security impact analyses;

- \[c_obj\] documents configuration change decisions associated with the information system;

- \[d_obj\] implements approved configuration-controlled changes to the information system;

- \[e_obj\]

  - \[1\] defines a time period to retain records of configuration-controlled changes to the information system;
  - \[2\] retains records of configuration-controlled changes to the information system for the organization-defined time period;

- \[f_obj\] audits and reviews activities associated with configuration-controlled changes to the information system;

- \[g_obj\]

  - \[1\] defines a configuration change control element (e.g., committee, board) responsible for coordinating and providing oversight for configuration change control activities;
  - \[2\] defines the frequency with which the configuration change control element must convene; and/or
  - \[3\] defines configuration change conditions that prompt the configuration change control element to convene; and
  - \[4\] coordinates and provides oversight for configuration change control activities through organization-defined configuration change control element that convenes at organization-defined frequency and/or for any organization-defined configuration change conditions.

## Control guidance

Configuration change controls for organizational information systems involve the systematic proposal, justification, implementation, testing, review, and disposition of changes to the systems, including system upgrades and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to baseline configurations for components and configuration items of information systems, changes to configuration settings for information technology products (e.g., operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers, and mobile devices), unscheduled/unauthorized changes, and changes to remediate vulnerabilities. Typical processes for managing configuration changes to information systems include, for example, Configuration Control Boards that approve proposed changes to systems. For new development information systems or systems undergoing major upgrades, organizations consider including representatives from development organizations on the Configuration Control Boards. Auditing of changes includes activities before and after changes are made to organizational information systems and the auditing activities required to implement such changes.
