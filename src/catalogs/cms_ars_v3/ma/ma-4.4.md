# ma-4.4 - \[Maintenance\] Authentication / Separation of Maintenance Sessions

## Control Statement

The organization protects nonlocal maintenance sessions by:

- \[a\] Employing {{ insert: param, ma-4.4_prm_1 }}; and

- \[b\] Separating the maintenance sessions from other network sessions with the information system by either:

  - \[1\] Physically separated communications paths; or
  - \[2\] Logically separated communications paths based upon encryption.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization protects nonlocal maintenance sessions by:

- \[a_obj\]

  - \[1\] defining replay resistant authenticators to be employed to protect nonlocal maintenance sessions;
  - \[2\] employing organization-defined authenticators that are replay resistant;

- \[b_obj\] separating the maintenance sessions from other network sessions with the information system by either:

  - \[1_obj\] physically separated communications paths; or
  - \[2_obj\] logically separated communications paths based upon encryption.
