## Control Statement

The organization employs a wireless intrusion detection system to identify rogue wireless devices and to detect attack attempts and potential compromises/breaches to the information system.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization employs a wireless intrusion detection system to:

- \[1\] identify rogue wireless devices;

- \[2\] detect attack attempts to the information system; and

## Control guidance

Wireless signals may radiate beyond the confines of organization-controlled facilities.

Scans are not limited to those areas within facilities containing information systems, but also include areas outside of facilities as needed, to verify that unauthorized wireless access points are not connected to the systems.
