# sa-15 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Development Process, Standards, and Tools

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a\] Requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to follow a documented development process that:

  - \[1\] Explicitly addresses security requirements;
  - \[2\] Identifies the standards and tools used in the development process;
  - \[3\] Documents the specific tool options and tool configurations used in the development process; and
  - \[4\] Documents, manages, and ensures the integrity of changes to the process and/or tools used in development; and

- \[b\] Reviews the development process, standards, tools, and tool options/configurations {{ insert: param, sa-15_prm_1 }} to determine if the process, standards, tools, and tool options/configurations selected and employed can satisfy {{ insert: param, sa-15_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[a_obj\] requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to follow a documented development process that:

  - \[1_obj\] explicitly addresses security requirements;
  - \[2_obj\] identifies the standards and tools used in the development process;
  - \[3_obj\]

    - \[1\] documents the specific tool options used in the development process;
    - \[2\] documents the specific tool configurations used in the development process;

  - \[4_obj\]

    - \[1\] documents changes to the process and/or tools used in the development;
    - \[2\] manages changes to the process and/or tools used in the development;
    - \[3\] ensures the integrity of changes to the process and/or tools used in the development;

- \[b_obj\]

  - \[1\] defines a frequency to review the development process, standards, tools, and tool options/configurations;
  - \[2\] defines security requirements to be satisfied by the process, standards, tools, and tool option/configurations selected and employed; and
  - \[3\]

    - \[a\] reviews the development process with the organization-defined frequency to determine if the process selected and employed can satisfy organization-defined security requirements;
    - \[b\] reviews the development standards with the organization-defined frequency to determine if the standards selected and employed can satisfy organization-defined security requirements;
    - \[c\] reviews the development tools with the organization-defined frequency to determine if the tools selected and employed can satisfy organization-defined security requirements; and
    - \[d\] reviews the development tool options/configurations with the organization-defined frequency to determine if the tool options/configurations selected and employed can satisfy organization-defined security requirements.

## Control guidance

Development tools include, for example, programming languages and computer-aided design (CAD) systems. Reviews of development processes can include, for example, the use of maturity models to determine the potential effectiveness of such processes. Maintaining the integrity of changes to tools and processes enables accurate supply chain risk assessment and mitigation, and requires robust configuration control throughout the life cycle (including design, development, transport, delivery, integration, and maintenance) to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes.
