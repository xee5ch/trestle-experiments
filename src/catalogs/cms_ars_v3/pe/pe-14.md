# pe-14 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Temperature and Humidity Controls

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a\] Maintains temperature and humidity levels within the facility where the information system resides at {{ insert: param, pe-14_prm_1 }}; and

- \[b\] Monitors temperature and humidity levels {{ insert: param, pe-14_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[a_obj\]

  - \[1\] defines acceptable temperature levels to be maintained within the facility where the information system resides;
  - \[2\] defines acceptable humidity levels to be maintained within the facility where the information system resides;
  - \[3\] maintains temperature levels within the facility where the information system resides at the organization-defined levels;
  - \[4\] maintains humidity levels within the facility where the information system resides at the organization-defined levels;

- \[b_obj\]

  - \[1\] defines the frequency to monitor temperature levels;
  - \[2\] defines the frequency to monitor humidity levels;
  - \[3\] monitors temperature levels with the organization-defined frequency; and
  - \[4\] monitors humidity levels with the organization-defined frequency.

## Control guidance

This control applies primarily to facilities containing concentrations of information system resources, for example, data centers, server rooms, and mainframe computer rooms.
