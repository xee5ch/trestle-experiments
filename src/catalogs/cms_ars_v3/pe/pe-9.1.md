# pe-9.1 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Redundant Cabling

## Control Statement

The organization employs redundant power cabling paths that are physically separated by {{ insert: param, pe-9.1_prm_1 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[1\] defines the distance by which redundant power cabling paths are to be physically separated; and

- \[2\] employs redundant power cabling paths that are physically separated by organization-defined distance.

## Control guidance

Physically separate, redundant power cables help to ensure that power continues to flow in the event one of the cables is cut or otherwise damaged.
