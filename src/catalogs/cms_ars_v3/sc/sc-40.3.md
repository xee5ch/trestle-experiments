# sc-40.3 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Imitative or Manipulative Communications Deception

## Control Statement

The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to identify and reject wireless transmissions that are deliberate attempts to achieve imitative or manipulative communications deception based on signal parameters.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to:

- \[1\] identify wireless transmissions that are deliberate attempts to achieve imitative or manipulative communications deception based on signal parameters; and

- \[2\] reject wireless transmissions that are deliberate attempts to achieve imitative or manipulative communications deception based on signal parameters.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement ensures that the signal parameters of wireless transmissions are not predictable by unauthorized individuals. Such unpredictability reduces the probability of imitative or manipulative communications deception based upon signal parameters alone.
