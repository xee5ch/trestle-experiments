# sc-28 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Protection of Information at Rest

## Control Statement

The information system protects the {{ insert: param, sc-28_prm_1 }} of {{ insert: param, sc-28_prm_2 }}.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[1\] the organization defines information at rest requiring one or more of the following:

  - \[a\] confidentiality protection; and/or
  - \[b\] integrity protection;

- \[2\] the information system protects:

  - \[a\] the confidentiality of organization-defined information at rest; and/or
  - \[b\] the integrity of organization-defined information at rest.

## Control guidance

This control addresses the confidentiality and integrity of information at rest and covers user information and system information. Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on storage devices as specific components of information systems. System-related information requiring protection includes, for example, configurations or rule sets for firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection/prevention systems, filtering routers, and authenticator content. Organizations may employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity protection can be achieved, for example, by implementing Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) technologies. Organizations may also employ other security controls including, for example, secure off-line storage in lieu of online storage when adequate protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved and/or continuous monitoring to identify malicious code at rest.
