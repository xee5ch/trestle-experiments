## Control Statement

The information system prevents the automatic execution of mobile code in {{ insert: param, sc-18.4_prm_1 }} and enforces {{ insert: param, sc-18.4_prm_2 }} prior to executing the code.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[1\] the organization defines software applications in which the automatic execution of mobile code is to be prohibited;

- \[2\] the organization defines actions to be enforced by the information system prior to executing mobile code;

- \[3\] the information system prevents the automatic execution of mobile code in the organization-defined software applications; and

- \[4\] the information system enforces organization-defined actions prior to executing the code.

## Control guidance

Actions enforced before executing mobile code, include, for example, prompting users prior to opening electronic mail attachments. Preventing automatic execution of mobile code includes, for example, disabling auto execute features on information system components employing portable storage devices such as Compact Disks (CDs), Digital Video Disks (DVDs), and Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices.
