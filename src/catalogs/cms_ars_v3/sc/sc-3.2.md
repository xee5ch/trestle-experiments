# sc-3.2 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Access / Flow Control Functions

## Control Statement

The information system isolates security functions enforcing access and information flow control from nonsecurity functions and from other security functions.

## Control Objective

Determine if the information system isolates security functions enforcing:

- \[1\] access control from nonsecurity functions;

- \[2\] information flow control from nonsecurity functions;

- \[3\] access control from other security functions; and

- \[4\] information flow control from other security functions.

## Control guidance

Security function isolation occurs as a result of implementation; the functions can still be scanned and monitored. Security functions that are potentially isolated from access and flow control enforcement functions include, for example, auditing, intrusion detection, and anti-virus functions.
