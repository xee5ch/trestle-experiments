# au-10.4 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Validate Binding of Information Reviewer Identity

## Control Statement

The information system:

- \[a\] Validates the binding of the information reviewer identity to the information at the transfer or release points prior to release/transfer between {{ insert: param, au-10.4_prm_1 }}; and

- \[b\] Performs {{ insert: param, au-10.4_prm_2 }} in the event of a validation error.

## Control Objective

Determine if:

- \[a_obj\]

  - \[1\] the organization defines security domains for which the binding of the information reviewer identity to the information is to be validated at the transfer or release points prior to release/transfer between such domains;
  - \[2\] the information system validates the binding of the information reviewer identity to the information at the transfer or release points prior to release/transfer between organization-defined security domains;

- \[b_obj\]

  - \[1\] the organization defines actions to be performed in the event of a validation error; and
  - \[2\] the information system performs organization-defined actions in the event of a validation error.

## Control guidance

This control enhancement prevents the modification of information between review and transfer/release. The validation of bindings can be achieved, for example, by the use of cryptographic checksums. Organizations determine validations are in response to user requests or generated automatically.
